End to End Serverless ELT with Google Cloud, dbt and Terraform

The ELT pipeline weâ€™ve developed leverages several Google Cloud Services including Google Cloud Storage (GCS), BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Cloud Workflows, Cloud Run, and Cloud Build. We also use dbt for data transformation and Terraform for infrastructure as code.

Deploy services in Google Cloud
================

Navigate to **infra folder**, we gonna deploy the project using Terraform :

1. Initialize your Terraform workspace, which will download the provider plugins for Google Cloud: `terraform init`
2. Plan the deployment and review the changes: `terraform plan`
3. If everything looks good, apply the changes: `terraform apply`

Testing
===========================
Finally to test the workflow from end to end, we can lunch the script in **scripts folder**:

`sh upload_include_dataset_to_gcs.sh`
